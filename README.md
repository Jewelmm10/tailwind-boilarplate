# Tailwind CSS Boilerplate

An unstyled starter template for Tailwind CSS v3.0 with predefined file paths - a great boilerplate for starting a new Tailwind CSS project.

## Installation

To get started:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Jewelmm10/Booking-site.git`
    cd tailwind-boilerplate

    ```

2. Install the dependencies:
    ```
    # npm
    npm install

    ```

3. Start up development server
    ```
    # npm
    npm run start

    ```

#### To build for production

The production code is optimized using css minify. 

To run

```
    # npm
    npm run minify

   ```
This will create a minify css file in `assets/css/style.min.css`
